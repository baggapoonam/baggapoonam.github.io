## Understanding the problem

One of the most valuable lessons I have learned throughout my career is that successful analysis starts with understanding the problem. Before working with data, I focus on understanding business problem, objectives, stakeholder needs, and the decisions that need to be made.



## Asking Questions

WHY ASKING BETTER QUESTIONS MATTERS MORE THAN HAVING THE RIGHT ANSWERS

Learning analytics reinforced what my experience had already taught me that asking the right questions often matters more than finding quick answers. Data can reveal what is happening, but thoughtful questions help uncover why it is happening.


### The Insight

> Insight = Data + Context + Curiosity

As I developed analytical skills, I discovered that data is only part of the story. Meaningful insights come from combining information with context, curiosity, and critical thinking.

### Understanding the story

Whether reviewing stakeholder feedback, survey results, data spreadsheets or operational metrics, the real value comes from understanding the story behind the numbers.

> Skills Strengthened: 
Critical Thinking, Business Analysis, Root Cause Analysis, Stakeholder Engagement, Decision Support
